📘 DSA Project Report — Game Inventory Manager
1. Introduction

This project implements a simple Game Inventory Management System using Singly Linked Lists in C++.
The program allows users to add, remove, search, and display game items.
It demonstrates practical use of dynamic data structures taught in the Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) course.

2. Objectives

To understand and implement Linked List operations

To practice dynamic memory management using pointers

To implement insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal

To create a menu-driven program for user interaction

3. Data Structure Used — Singly Linked List

A Singly Linked List is used to store inventory items dynamically.

Each node contains:

ID

Name

Quantity

Pointer to the next node

Why Linked List?

Efficient insertion and deletion

No need for contiguous memory

Flexible and dynamic structure

Operations implemented:

Insertion (Add item)

Deletion (Remove item by ID)

Search (Find item by ID)

Traversal (Display all items)

4. Program Functionalities

Add Item
Adds a new item at the end of the linked list.

Remove Item
Removes an item by matching its ID.

Search Item
Searches the list and displays the item's details.

Display Inventory
Shows all the items in the inventory using list traversal.

5. Conclusion

This project helped demonstrate how linked lists can be used in real-world applications.
It strengthened understanding of:

Pointers

Node creation

Memory management

Linked list operations

The Game Inventory Manager is a simple yet effective implementation of DSA concepts.
